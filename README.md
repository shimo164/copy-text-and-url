# Rich Text Copy

"Rich Text Copy" is a Chrome extension that allows users to quickly copy selected text or, if no text is selected, the title of a tab as a rich-text hyperlink or a markdown link. With just a simple right-click, you can transform your text selections into clickable links, ready for sharing.

Note: This extension works only on web pages that start with http:// or https://.

On the Options page, you can independently choose how to copy content: either as a rich-text hyperlink or a markdown link for both selected text and the title of the tab."
